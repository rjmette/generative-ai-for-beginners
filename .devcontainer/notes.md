What is a metaprompt?

Metaprompts and grounding are ways we can direct or limit the model based on certain behaviors and information. This could be using system inputs to define certain limits of the model. In addition, providing outputs that are more relevant to the scope or domain of the system.

As you're interested in leveraging AI for product development, a metaprompt could be: "Provide insights on AI application in product development, focusing on innovative use-cases and integration strategies."
